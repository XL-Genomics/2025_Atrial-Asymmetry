## Functional Asymmetry of Cardiac Macrophages in Left and Right Atria
The left (LA) and right atria (RA) differ in physiology and molecular composition. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of mouse atria revealed distinct cell states, with RA stromal cells showing higher metabolic activity, oxidative stress, and immune-related gene expression. RA macrophages (MPs) were enriched in pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMPs), while LA harbored more anti-inflammatory tissue-resident macrophages (TRMPs). This immune asymmetry was confirmed in humans. MoMP depletion in mice led to disrupted atrial conduction and increased atrial fibrillation (AFib) susceptibility, underscoring their role in RA homeostasis. A balanced immune environment in the RA is crucial for preventing atrial diseases like AFib.
